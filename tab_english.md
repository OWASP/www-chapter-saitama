## Our mission

In our chapter,

*1. We provide freedom of speech.*

We consider free speech is most important, as well as responsible disclosure, especially in the topics of cybersecurity field. For that mission we seek speakers' psycological security, e.g. we do not allow audio/video recording and disclosure, without speakers' explicit permission, of any of our talk sessions.

*2. We seek comprehensive knowledge.*

We consider any meaningful awareness is provided only with timely and comprehensive knowledge. For that mission we prefer actual/precise/real-life topics to abstract ones.

*3. We seek real skills.*

We consider it is important to distribute not only knowledge but also skills. For that mission we will occussionally hold workshops.

*4. We seek fun.*

We believe that fun is an important factor of any fruitful research. For that mission we will strive to provide easy and cozy environment.
